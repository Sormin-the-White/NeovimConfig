Getting the latest version of neovim is kind of weird, so do this:
Compiling from Source:
Another option is to compile Neovim from source. This allows you to install the latest development version or a specific version that meets your requirements.

Here's a simplified outline of how you can compile Neovim from source:

Install Build Dependencies:

Make sure you have the necessary build dependencies installed on your system. You can typically find these in the Neovim GitHub repository or documentation.

Clone the Neovim Repository:

Clone the Neovim repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git

git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
Build Neovim:

*If cmake is not installed:
sudo apt install cmake
*If GetText tools are not installed
sudo apt install gettext
*If ripgrep is not installed
sudo apt install ripgrep

Navigate into the cloned repository and run the build commands:
cd neovim
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
sudo make install

cd neovim
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
sudo make install
Adjust the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE according to your needs (e.g., Release, Debug, etc.).

After installation, you should have the latest version of Neovim available on your system. Ensure that the Neovim binary is available in your system's PATH so that you can run it from anywhere in your terminal.
